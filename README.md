# Order Management System
Let's build a very simple order management system having orders from pending up to completed state.

## Requirements

An order has a control number and a state.

When the order is added to the system, it has a pending state.

I want to be able to start the progress of an order.

I want to be able to complete an order.

I want to filter orders by number control and state.

## Invariants
A pending order can only go to in progress state.

An in progress order can only go to completed.

Completed orders are done and should preserve its state.

## Instructions
Create a github repo to develop your solution.

PS 1: Using a css library/framework is a plus.

PS 2: Tests are needed.

PS 3: Weâ€™ll evaluate everything from the git history to the implemented code.
